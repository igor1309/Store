>During the process of building our applications, we are often faced with the need of persisting and querying model objects in some form of store. The store can be a remote server, a local CoreData database, a set of files, or even a PostgreSQL or MySQL database (if the models are shared between the server and client code). It is also not uncommon to have to manage a combination of 2 or more stores (e.g. saving to a remote server and to CoreData at the same time and retrieving from CoreData when there is no internet connectivity).  
>In this article, we'll explore how using Swift features such as protocols, generics, enumerations, and key paths, we can build expressive, type-safe and testable data access layers.
